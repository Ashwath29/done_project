            <p id="answers">In arithmetic, the least common multiple or LCM of two numbers say a and b, is denoted as LCM (a,b). The LCM is the smallest or least positive integer that is divisible by both a and b.

                The Least Common Multiple (LCM) is a way of finding the smallest common multiple between any two numbers or more. A common multiple is a multiple of two numbers or more. LCM denotes the less common or multiple factors of any two or more given integers.
                
                (i) 26 and 91
                Given integers are: 26 and 91
                
                First, let us find out the prime factors of 26 and 91.
                
                26 = 2 × 13
                
                91 = 7 × 13
                
                ∴ L.C.M (26, 91) = 2 × 7 × 13 = 182
                
                And,
                
                H.C.F (26, 91) = 13
                
                Verification:
                
                L.C.M × H.C.F = 182 x 13= 2366
                
                And, product of the integers = 26 x 91 = 2366
                
                ∴ L.C.M × H.C.F = product of the integers
                
                Hence verified.
                
                (ii) 510 and 92
                Solution:
                
                Given integers are: 510 and 92
                
                First, let us find out the prime factors of 510 and 92.
                
                510 = 2 × 3 × 5 × 17
                
                92 = 2 × 2 × 23
                
                ∴ L.C.M (510, 92) = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 × 23 × 17 = 23460
                
                And,
                
                H.C.F (510, 92) = 2
                
                Verification:
                
                L.C.M × H.C.F = 23460 x 2 = 46920
                
                And, product of the integers = 510 x 92 = 46920
                
                ∴ L.C.M × H.C.F = product of the integers
                
                Hence verified.
                
                (iii) 336 and 54
                Solution:
                
                Given integers are: 336 and 54
                
                First, let us find out the prime factors of 336 and 54.
                
                336 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 7
                
                54 = 2 × 3 × 3 x 3
                
                ∴ L.C.M (336, 54) = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 7 = 3024
                
                And,
                
                H.C.F (336, 54) = 2 x 3 = 6
                
                Verification:
                
                L.C.M × H.C.F = 3024 x 6 = 18144
                
                And, product of the integers = 336 x 54 = 18144
                
                ∴ L.C.M × H.C.F = product of the integers
                
                Hence verified.
